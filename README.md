Theming.py is for:
KivyMD v +2.0.0 Color visiualization for different type of schemes and theme styles to reference during designing.
Since the app example in Dynamic Color section of KivyMD is not working. I tried to create one to work with.
Only bug i noticed is that you need to select a color twice to make the color take effect. 
Icon.py is already KivyMD's own icon selection app.
